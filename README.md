# Game

A classic Rock, Paper, Scissor Game!

Created this to practice my python programming skills, trying to get more familiar with loops and conditionals. Now I have decided to keep this game as my first GitHub Repo. I will be updating this program as I progress through my semester. I intend to make it more engaging with an interactive GUI and a smoother gameflow as I improvise :)
